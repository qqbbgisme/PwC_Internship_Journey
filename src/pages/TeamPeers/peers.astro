    Interning at PwC wasn't just about projects and deadlines—it was equally about the bonds I formed with my fellow interns, or "batchmates," who turned the office into a vibrant community. As someone who joined a bit later than most, these peers quickly became my lifeline, injecting fun, camaraderie, and shared motivation into long days. We bonded over late-night ramen runs, Friday gatherings, and mutual commiseration on tough tasks, creating memories that made the internship feel like a true adventure. They reminded me that professional growth thrives in a supportive circle of friends. Here's to the standout folks who made it unforgettable.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Partner in Crime and Ramen Confidant</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Tom was hands-down the most important person from my batch—the ultimate partner in crime who made every moment more bearable and infinitely more fun. Without him, I would've felt lost in a sea of seriousness; with him, the internship sparkled with laughter and inside jokes. We clicked instantly when we met, both lamenting that we hadn't crossed paths sooner, and our friendship bloomed from there. Interestingly, I was the only one who truly "got" him—everyone else saw him as this enigmatic mystery man, but to me, he was an open book of wit and warmth.

    Since I onboarded later, Tom became my sole ally in those early, isolating weeks, and I'm endlessly grateful for it. We'd tackle work struggles side by side: when the manager piled on assignments, we'd divvy them up, power through together, and knock them out ASAP, turning stress into a team sport. He wasn't just a colleague; he was the best workplace friend I've ever had, the kind who elevates everything. Our off-hours adventures sealed the deal—we're both ramen obsessives, so we systematically conquered every spot in Central, slurping noodles while dissecting work drama, personal dreams, family stories, career ambitions, and everything in between. Those unfiltered chats grounded me, and I'm so thankful for the rare gem of a friendship that emerged from this experience.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Vincci, Henry, and Oscar: The Original Squad and Heartfelt Crew</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    My first wave of batchmates—Vincci, Henry, and Oscar—welcomed me with open arms, becoming the foundation of my social circle at PwC. They were the epitome of kindness and good vibes, making me feel like I'd been part of the group all along. Vincci, in particular, leveled up our dynamic; she, Tom, and I formed this tight-knit "small squad," trading tips on projects, venting about deadlines, and plotting our next hangout. Her easy energy kept things light and inclusive, turning casual chats into lasting connections.

    Henry brought the pure fun factor—he was the one cracking jokes during breaks that had us in stitches, and I still smile thinking about his heartfelt goodbye. As the internship wrapped, he pulled me aside, eyes misty, insisting we "keep in touch no matter what," which hit me right in the feels and underscored how genuine these bonds were. Oscar rounded out the trio with his chill, reliable presence, always up for a quick debrief or a laugh over shared mishaps.

    The rest of the batchmates were just as wonderful—all easy-going souls who made the office feel like home. We'd cap off Fridays with casual gatherings, whether grabbing drinks or just chilling, where I'd peel back the layers and get to know them beyond the desks: their quirks, aspirations, and what fueled their drive. Everyone was a good person at heart, quick to celebrate wins and lift each other through slumps.

    Looking back, my batchmates weren't just peers—they were the heartbeat of my PwC journey, proving that the best professional experiences are laced with personal magic. I've stayed connected with Tom, Vincci, Henry, Oscar, and the crew, and those Friday vibes still echo in our group chats. Grateful doesn't even cover it; they've shown me how friendships forged in the fire of internships can fuel careers and beyond.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">The Coolest Manager and Career Guide</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Tak, another key manager on the team, was hands-down the coolest leader I've encountered—nonchalant, approachable, and deeply insightful. He regularly opened up about his career highs and lows, offering invaluable advice on kickstarting my post-graduation path that I still reflect on today. I had the chance to observe his polished client interactions firsthand, absorbing how poise and preparation command respect.

      Tak's calm under pressure was legendary. When I made a major error in the BBPOS configuration, he didn't raise his voice; instead, he guided me through fixes with steady instructions. To lighten the mood, he even rallied the two senior associates to treat the team to a great meal. A strong advocate for balance, Tak forbade unnecessary overtime, often letting us wrap up early on Fridays to recharge after intense weeks. He understood the power of rewards over stress, and he championed a "speak up" culture fiercely—once getting genuinely upset when a senior associate burned out in silence, using it as a rallying cry for everyone to voice their needs openly.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Yanes and Ivy: The Detail-Oriented Duo and Sisterly Support</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Rounding out the team were the two senior associates, Yanes and Ivy—truly the best colleagues I've ever worked with. Yanes was a master of precision, meticulously reviewing our work before client handoffs to catch potential pitfalls and save us from embarrassment. She dove deep into SAP Configuration training, letting me hands-on with the real system, and empowered me to create user manuals and lead UAT testing. Through her, I gained a holistic view of how the system truly operates from setup to execution.
      
      Ivy, on the other hand, was the sweetest soul—like a big sister who had our backs at every turn. She was my absolute favorite, always reminding us not to overwork and stepping in gracefully when tasks spilled over. "It's okay if it's not done today; I'll handle the rest," she'd say, easing the pressure without compromising quality. After my big configuration mistake, Ivy jumped in to brainstorm fixes alongside me, offering encouragement instead of criticism—she never scolded, only uplifted. Her kindness extended beyond work; she frequently treated me to delicious meals, making the office feel like a second home.

      I'm beyond grateful that I've stayed in touch with Yuko, Tak, Yanes, and Ivy post-internship. Their impact lingers in every project I tackle, reminding me that great teams aren't just about hitting deadlines—they're about building people up along the way. PwC's collaborative spirit shone brightest through them, and I'm excited to carry their lessons forward in my career.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Shoutout to my other colleagues: Dennis, Chaline and Sophia</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Beyond our immediate team, I was lucky to have a network of allies who went out of their way to support me, turning potential roadblocks into breakthroughs.

      Dennis, a manager from another team, became an unexpected lifesaver when I needed specialized HR domain knowledge. Despite his packed schedule, he carved out time to dive into my queries, breaking down complex concepts with patience and clarity that bridged my knowledge gaps seamlessly.
  
      Chalin, equally swamped with her own project hurtling toward its official go-live, never hesitated to jump on a Teams call whenever I hit a snag. Her willingness to pause her high-stakes work to troubleshoot my challenges spoke volumes about her generosity and commitment to knowledge-sharing.
  
      Last but certainly not least, Sophia—a senior associate on the UST project—guided me with such warmth and expertise that she felt like a guardian angel. I could bombard her with any question, big or small, and she always responded with kindness, treating me like a peer rather than a junior. She shared clever tactics to elevate my PPTs, from subtle design tweaks to storytelling flows that made content pop. When project hiccups arose, Sophia stepped in to handle the aftermath and consequences, shielding me from fallout while helping me push through to deliver the decks on time. Without her, I honestly wouldn't have crossed the finish line—her support was indispensable
