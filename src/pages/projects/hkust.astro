<ProjectPage title="Project - HKUST Technical Proposal">

  <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Project Background</h1>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    In the first two months of my PwC internship, I contributed to a high-stakes bidding project advising a university on upgrading its HR system or transitioning to a full ERP solution, with a focus on SAP SuccessFactors for processes like recruitment, onboarding, and contract renewal. My role evolved from initial research on university recruitment platforms and academia-specific terminology to sourcing deliverables for a 200+ slide PowerPoint proposal deck. I collaborated with a senior associate to draft HR module sections, analyzed the client's as-is processes against benchmarks from other universities, and proposed to-be workflows with real-world examples. The project advanced through three competitive presentation rounds, incorporating insights from interviews with PwC directors in the US and Singapore. In the second half of the internship, I supported the post-bid phase by drafting a detailed contract with HR-specific terms, a task typically handled by senior staff. This project culminated in winning the bid, validating our team's expertise in higher education HR implementations.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Major Challenge</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Navigating ambiguity as a consulting newcomer was tough—early research felt disjointed without full project context, requiring me to seek clarifications while building independent research skills. Sourcing relevant deliverables from past projects was frustrating; despite multiple manager explanations, I initially selected irrelevant items, leading to extra supervision and a three-day learning curve on what constitutes a "deliverable." Tight deadlines intensified pressure: creating new decks in just two weeks for the second round and one week for the third, all while addressing client pain points, pricing adjustments, and competitive differentiators. A personal setback occurred when my manager was hospitalized for a week, forcing me to pivot to direct partner feedback and incorporate innovative pitching strategies under heightened scrutiny.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      This project demystified the consulting bidding lifecycle, teaching me the art of crafting visually compelling slides—balancing detail for impact while avoiding overexposure to anticipate client needs. I learned the value of persistence in fast-paced environments, iterating quickly on contrasting feedback from partners to refine proposals. Building internal networks through director interviews broadened my global perspective on HR projects, while the win boosted my confidence in high-stakes contributions. Overall, it honed my adaptability, research, and communication skills, emphasizing creativity and charisma in client pitches to drive successful outcomes.
