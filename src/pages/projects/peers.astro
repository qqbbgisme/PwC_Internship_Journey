    Interning at PwC wasn't just about projects and deadlines—it was equally about the bonds I formed with my fellow interns, or "batchmates," who turned the office into a vibrant community. As someone who joined a bit later than most, these peers quickly became my lifeline, injecting fun, camaraderie, and shared motivation into long days. We bonded over late-night ramen runs, Friday gatherings, and mutual commiseration on tough tasks, creating memories that made the internship feel like a true adventure. They reminded me that professional growth thrives in a supportive circle of friends. Here's to the standout folks who made it unforgettable.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Partner in Crime and Ramen Confidant</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Tom was hands-down the most important person from my batch—the ultimate partner in crime who made every moment more bearable and infinitely more fun. Without him, I would've felt lost in a sea of seriousness; with him, the internship sparkled with laughter and inside jokes. We clicked instantly when we met, both lamenting that we hadn't crossed paths sooner, and our friendship bloomed from there. Interestingly, I was the only one who truly "got" him—everyone else saw him as this enigmatic mystery man, but to me, he was an open book of wit and warmth.

    Since I onboarded later, Tom became my sole ally in those early, isolating weeks, and I'm endlessly grateful for it. We'd tackle work struggles side by side: when the manager piled on assignments, we'd divvy them up, power through together, and knock them out ASAP, turning stress into a team sport. He wasn't just a colleague; he was the best workplace friend I've ever had, the kind who elevates everything. Our off-hours adventures sealed the deal—we're both ramen obsessives, so we systematically conquered every spot in Central, slurping noodles while dissecting work drama, personal dreams, family stories, career ambitions, and everything in between. Those unfiltered chats grounded me, and I'm so thankful for the rare gem of a friendship that emerged from this experience.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Vincci, Henry, and Oscar: The Original Squad and Heartfelt Crew</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    My first wave of batchmates—Vincci, Henry, and Oscar—welcomed me with open arms, becoming the foundation of my social circle at PwC. They were the epitome of kindness and good vibes, making me feel like I'd been part of the group all along. Vincci, in particular, leveled up our dynamic; she, Tom, and I formed this tight-knit "small squad," trading tips on projects, venting about deadlines, and plotting our next hangout. Her easy energy kept things light and inclusive, turning casual chats into lasting connections.

    Henry brought the pure fun factor—he was the one cracking jokes during breaks that had us in stitches, and I still smile thinking about his heartfelt goodbye. As the internship wrapped, he pulled me aside, eyes misty, insisting we "keep in touch no matter what," which hit me right in the feels and underscored how genuine these bonds were. Oscar rounded out the trio with his chill, reliable presence, always up for a quick debrief or a laugh over shared mishaps.

    The rest of the batchmates were just as wonderful—all easy-going souls who made the office feel like home. We'd cap off Fridays with casual gatherings, whether grabbing drinks or just chilling, where I'd peel back the layers and get to know them beyond the desks: their quirks, aspirations, and what fueled their drive. Everyone was a good person at heart, quick to celebrate wins and lift each other through slumps.

    Looking back, my batchmates weren't just peers—they were the heartbeat of my PwC journey, proving that the best professional experiences are laced with personal magic. I've stayed connected with Tom, Vincci, Henry, Oscar, and the crew, and those Friday vibes still echo in our group chats. Grateful doesn't even cover it; they've shown me how friendships forged in the fire of internships can fuel careers and beyond.
