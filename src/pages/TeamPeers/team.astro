<ProjectPage title="My Team">

  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Throughout my internship at PwC, I was fortunate to be part of an incredibly supportive and dynamic team in the Technology Consulting group, specializing in SAP SuccessFactors. Their guidance, encouragement, and genuine care turned what could have been a daunting experience into one of the most rewarding chapters of my professional journey. From day one, the team treated me not just as an intern, but as a valued contributor, fostering an environment of trust, open communication, and work-life balance. Here's a glimpse into the incredible individuals who made it all possible.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Mike: The Charismatic Partner and Leadership Beacon</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Leading our team was Partner Mike Li, whose easy-going nature, magnetic charisma, and exceptional leadership style made him an inspiring figure. I remember the pivotal moment when my line manager, Yuko, was out sick and unable to work—she directed me to seek guidance from Mike directly. As a nervous intern with zero experience interacting at the partner level, I was intimidated at first, unsure of how to even approach the conversation. But Mike shattered those fears effortlessly; he was incredibly approachable, sitting down with me to draft a clear process flow right in the PowerPoint deck. This not only clarified my expectations for the final deliverables but also gave me a roadmap to navigate the project confidently.

    Mike was never stingy with his wisdom—he openly shared his professional aspirations and practical strategies for getting things done more effectively. Whether it was refining slide layouts for maximum impact or polishing presentation narratives to captivate clients, his suggestions were always spot-on and actionable. Under his subtle yet powerful influence, I learned how true leadership amplifies team potential without overshadowing it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Yuko: My Line Manager and Mentorship Anchor</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    Yuko, my line manager, embodied the perfect blend of high expectations and unwavering support. She entrusted me with significant ownership right from onboarding, assigning me to critical projects and training me as if I were a full associate. Even in those early days, she welcomed every question—no matter how basic—and encouraged me to learn through trial and error, viewing mistakes as essential growth opportunities. A hustler herself, Yuko was always the first to arrive at the office, modeling relentless dedication while teaching practical skills like sourcing resources efficiently and crafting polished presentation decks.
    
    What truly set Yuko apart was her thoughtfulness and chill vibe amid the intensity. When I mentioned my dream trip to Turkey, she instantly shared her detailed itinerary as a reference. And after a grueling late night that stretched until 11 p.m., she granted me a half-day leave the next day without hesitation. She never left me adrift, always pairing me with a senior associate for guidance, ensuring I had the tools to succeed.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">The Coolest Manager and Career Guide</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Tak, another key manager on the team, was hands-down the coolest leader I've encountered—nonchalant, approachable, and deeply insightful. He regularly opened up about his career highs and lows, offering invaluable advice on kickstarting my post-graduation path that I still reflect on today. I had the chance to observe his polished client interactions firsthand, absorbing how poise and preparation command respect.

      Tak's calm under pressure was legendary. When I made a major error in the BBPOS configuration, he didn't raise his voice; instead, he guided me through fixes with steady instructions. To lighten the mood, he even rallied the two senior associates to treat the team to a great meal. A strong advocate for balance, Tak forbade unnecessary overtime, often letting us wrap up early on Fridays to recharge after intense weeks. He understood the power of rewards over stress, and he championed a "speak up" culture fiercely—once getting genuinely upset when a senior associate burned out in silence, using it as a rallying cry for everyone to voice their needs openly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Yanes and Ivy: The Detail-Oriented Duo and Sisterly Support</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Rounding out the team were the two senior associates, Yanes and Ivy—truly the best colleagues I've ever worked with. Yanes was a master of precision, meticulously reviewing our work before client handoffs to catch potential pitfalls and save us from embarrassment. She dove deep into SAP Configuration training, letting me hands-on with the real system, and empowered me to create user manuals and lead UAT testing. Through her, I gained a holistic view of how the system truly operates from setup to execution.
      
      Ivy, on the other hand, was the sweetest soul—like a big sister who had our backs at every turn. She was my absolute favorite, always reminding us not to overwork and stepping in gracefully when tasks spilled over. "It's okay if it's not done today; I'll handle the rest," she'd say, easing the pressure without compromising quality. After my big configuration mistake, Ivy jumped in to brainstorm fixes alongside me, offering encouragement instead of criticism—she never scolded, only uplifted. Her kindness extended beyond work; she frequently treated me to delicious meals, making the office feel like a second home.

      I'm beyond grateful that I've stayed in touch with Yuko, Tak, Yanes, and Ivy post-internship. Their impact lingers in every project I tackle, reminding me that great teams aren't just about hitting deadlines—they're about building people up along the way. PwC's collaborative spirit shone brightest through them, and I'm excited to carry their lessons forward in my career.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Shoutout to my other colleagues: Dennis, Chaline and Sophia</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
      Beyond our immediate team, I was lucky to have a network of allies who went out of their way to support me, turning potential roadblocks into breakthroughs.

      Dennis, a manager from another team, became an unexpected lifesaver when I needed specialized HR domain knowledge. Despite his packed schedule, he carved out time to dive into my queries, breaking down complex concepts with patience and clarity that bridged my knowledge gaps seamlessly.
  
      Chalin, equally swamped with her own project hurtling toward its official go-live, never hesitated to jump on a Teams call whenever I hit a snag. Her willingness to pause her high-stakes work to troubleshoot my challenges spoke volumes about her generosity and commitment to knowledge-sharing.
  
      Last but certainly not least, Sophia—a senior associate on the UST project—guided me with such warmth and expertise that she felt like a guardian angel. I could bombard her with any question, big or small, and she always responded with kindness, treating me like a peer rather than a junior. She shared clever tactics to elevate my PPTs, from subtle design tweaks to storytelling flows that made content pop. When project hiccups arose, Sophia stepped in to handle the aftermath and consequences, shielding me from fallout while helping me push through to deliver the decks on time. Without her, I honestly wouldn't have crossed the finish line—her support was indispensable
